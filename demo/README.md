# PREC and Shacled Turtle demonstration website

Frontend code for Shacled Turtle demonstration.

*Getting started*
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

*Available pages*:
- `index.html`: Shacled Turtle with two editors: one for the schema graph and another one for the data graph.
- `shacl.hmtl`: On the left, a SHACL shape graph, on the right the data graph. It looks like your usual shacl graph validation website, but Shacled Turtle autocompletes the data graph.
- `st-readme-example.html`: The minimal working example exposed on the Shacled Turtle README.
- `with-debug-state.html`: Only a data editor with additional debug information to understand what the code does
